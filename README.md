# hopfield_network
A demo of a hopfield network, a model of autoassociative memory. The jupyter notebooks train the network on three different patterns, and illustrates recall of patterns both learned and spurious. It also generates a gif of the network settling on a pattern when given some input.

**Some pieces of this are WIP, especially my implementation of the Storkey Rule. I don't guarantee the correctness of anything.**
