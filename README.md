# hopfield_network
A demo of a hopfield network, a model of autoassociative memory. The jupyter notebook trains the network on three different patterns, and illustrates recall of patterns both learned and spurious. It also generates an gif of the network settling on a pattern when given some input.

**NOTE: The notebook for the storkey rule actually *DOESN'T WORK RIGHT NOW*. Something is wrong with my implementation of the storkey learning rule**
